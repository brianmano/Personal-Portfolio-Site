                      A huge challenge at Skyjack Plant 1 included the management of
                      Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs). Particularly, the daily influx of NCR'd
                      parts has created strain on material handlers, Quality Engineers (QEs),
                      supervisors, and NCR coordinators. When backlogs of NCRâ€™s occur often,
                      parts usually become disorganized, lost, or damaged. The physical space
                      constraints on the floor and in the yard add further complications.
                      Additionally, prolonged retention of NCR parts may result in obsolescence.
                      The current workload on the Material Review Board (MRB) team has led to
                      communication gaps, increasing the risk of mishandling and loss of parts.
                      Obsolescence, lost, damaged, or disorganized parts cost the plant huge
                      deficits in cost, as well as jeopardizes the safety of workers interacting
                      with the Paint NCR station.

                  Each cross arm can slide throughout the structure to adjust for any size of equipment. The maximum sizes of equipment was accounted for in the final dimensions. Along the sides of the shelf, 
                  specific NCR arms can be hung to make space as efficient as possible, as well as ease of access to parts as easy as possible.
